	abstract = {The α-proteobacterium Wolbachia is probably the most prevalent, vertically transmitted symbiont on Earth. In contrast with its wide distribution in arthropods, Wolbachia is restricted to one family of animal-parasitic nematodes, the Onchocercidae. This includes filarial pathogens such as Onchocerca volvulus, the cause of human onchocerciasis, or river blindness. The symbiosis between filariae and Wolbachia is obligate, although the basis of this dependency is not fully understood. Previous studies suggested that Wolbachia may provision metabolites (e.g., haem, riboflavin, and nucleotides) and/or contribute to immune defense. Importantly, Wolbachia is restricted to somatic tissues in adult male worms, whereas females also harbor bacteria in the germline. We sought to characterize the nature of the symbiosis between Wolbachia and O. ochengi, a bovine parasite representing the closest relative of O. volvulus. First, we sequenced the complete genome of Wolbachia strain {wOo}, which revealed an inability to synthesize riboflavin de novo. Using {RNA-seq}, we also generated endobacterial transcriptomes from male soma and female germline. In the soma, transcripts for membrane transport and respiration were up-regulated, while the gonad exhibited enrichment for {DNA} replication and translation. The most abundant Wolbachia proteins, as determined by {geLC-MS}, included ligands for mammalian Toll-like receptors. Enzymes involved in nucleotide synthesis were dominant among metabolism-related proteins, whereas the haem biosynthetic pathway was poorly represented. We conclude that Wolbachia may have a mitochondrion-like function in the soma, generating {ATP} for its host. Moreover, the abundance of immunogenic proteins in {wOo} suggests a role in diverting the immune system toward an ineffective antibacterial response.},

	abstract = {Vertically transmitted symbionts suffer a severe reduction in numbers when they pass through host generations, resulting in genetic homogeneity or even clonality of their populations. Wolbachia endosymbionts that induce cytoplasmic incompatibility in their hosts depart from this rule, because cytoplasmic incompatibility actively maintains multiple infection within hosts. Hosts and symbionts are thus probably under peculiar selective pressures that must shape the way intracellular bacterial populations are regulated. We studied the density and location of Wolbachia within adult Leptopilina heterotoma, a haplodiploid wasp that is parasitic on Drosophila and that is naturally infected with three Wolbachia strains, but for which we also obtained one simply infected and two doubly infected lines. Comparison of these four lines by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using a real-time detection system showed that total Wolbachia density varies according to the infection status of individuals, while the specific density of each Wolbachia strain remains constant regardless of the presence of other strains. This suggests that Wolbachia strains do not compete with one another within the same host individual, and that a strain-specific regulatory mechanism is operating. We discuss the regulatory mechanisms that are involved, and how this process might have evolved as a response to selective pressures acting on both partners.},

	abstract = {{Abstract.—Wolbachia-induced} cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI)} can have two consequences in haplodiploid insects: fertilized eggs either die (female mortality, {FM)} or they develop into haploid males (male development, {MD).} Origin of this diversity remains poorly understood, but current hypotheses invoke variation in damage suffered by paternal chromosomes in incompatible eggs, thus intermediate {CI} types should be expected. Here, we show the existence of such a particular {CI} type. In the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina heterotoma, we compared {CI} effects in crosses involving lines derived from a single inbred line with various Wolbachia infection statuses (natural tri-infection, mono-infection, or no infection). Tri-infected males induce a {FM} {CI} type when crossed with either uninfected or mono-infected females. Crossing mono-infected males with uninfected females results in almost complete {CI} with both reduced offspring production, indicating partial mortality of fertilized eggs, and increased number of sons, showing haploid male development of others. Mono-infected males thus induce an intermediate {CI} type when mated with uninfected females. The first evidence of this expected particular {CI} type demonstrates that no discontinuity separates {MD} and {FM} {CI} types, which appear to be end points of a phenotypic continuum. Second, different {CI} types can occur within a given species and even within offspring of a single pair. Third, phenotypic expression of the particular {CI} type induced by a given Wolbachia variant depends on other bacterial variants that co-infect the same tissues. These results support the idea that haplodiploids should be helpful in clarifying evolutionary pathways of insect-Wolbachia associations.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0003541},
	abstract = {Background 
Sodalis glossinidius, a maternally transmitted bacterial endosymbiont of tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), uses an acylated homoserine lactone ({AHL)-based} quorum sensing system to modulate gene expression in accordance with bacterial cell density. The S. glossinidius quorum sensing system relies on the function of two regulatory proteins; {SogI} (a {LuxI} homolog) synthesizes a signaling molecule, characterized as N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone ({OHHL)}, and {SogR1} (a {LuxR} homolog) interacts with {OHHL} to modulate transcription of specific target genes. 
 
{Methodology/Principal} Findings 
We used a tiling microarray to analyze the S. glossinidius transcriptome in the presence and absence of exogenous {OHHL.} The major finding is that {OHHL} increases transcription of a large number of genes that are known to be involved in the oxidative stress response. We also show that the obligate symbiont of the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae ({SOPE)}, maintains copies of the quorum sensing regulatory genes that are found in S. glossinidius. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicate that these sequences are evolving under stabilizing selection, consistent with the maintenance of their functions in the {SOPE} symbiosis. Finally, the expression studies in S. glossinidius also reveal that quorum sensing regulates the expression of a cryptic, degenerate gene ({carA)} that arose from an ancient deletion in the last common ancestor of S. glossinidius and {SOPE.} 
 
{Conclusions/Significance} 
This oxidative stress response is likely mandated under conditions of dense intracellular symbiont infection, when intense metabolic activity is expected to generate a heavy oxidative burden. Such conditions are known to arise in the bacteriocytes of grain weevils, which harbor dense intracellular infections of symbiotic bacteria that are closely related to S. glossinidius. The presence of a degenerate {carA} sequence in S. glossinidius and {SOPE} indicates the potential for neofunctionalization to occur during the process of genome degeneration.},
