Categorized by reductive evolution and streamlining, the genomes of some obligate intracellular bacteria manifest striking degrees of stability and gene synteny. However, recent findings from complete genome sequences of obligate intracellular species and their mobile genetic associates favour the abandonment of these wholesale terms for a more complex and tantalizing picture.},

Large-scale {DNA-sequence} analyses are revealing the forces that shape the evolution of these bacterial associates and the genetic basis of their specialization to an intracellular lifestyle. The full genome sequences of two obligate mutualists, Buchnera aphidicola of aphids and Wigglesworthia glossinidia of tsetse flies, reveal substantial gene loss and an integration of host and symbiont metabolic functions. Further genomic comparisons should reveal the generality of these features among bacterial mutualists and the extent to which they are shared with other intracellular bacteria, including obligate pathogens.},

	abstract = {Endosymbiotic Wolbachia infect a number of arthropod species in which they can affect the reproductive system. While maternally transmitted, unlike mitochondria their molecular phylogeny does not parallel that of their hosts. This strongly suggests horizontal transmission among species, the mechanisms of which remain unknown. Such transfers require intimate between-species relationships, and thus host-parasite associations are outstandingly appropriate for study. Here, we demonstrate that hymenopteran parasitoids of frugivorous Drosophila species are especially susceptible to Wolbachia infection. Of the five common European species, four proved to be infected; furthermore, multiple infections are common, with one species being doubly infected and two triply infected (first report). Phylogenetic statuses of the Wolbachia infecting the different species of the community have been studied using the gene wsp, a highly variable gene recently described. This study reveals exciting similarities between the Wolbachia variants found in parasitoids and their hosts. These arguments strongly support the hypothesis of frequent natural Wolbachia transfers into other species and open a new field for genetic exchanges among species, especially in host-parasitoid associations.},

@article{Cordaux2008,
	abstract = {Insertion sequences are transposable elements that can represent substantial proportions of prokaryotic genomes and play a substantial role in shaping host genome evolution. As such, evaluating and understanding insertion sequence diversity is an important task to fulfill, because it is expected to yield new insight into the evolution of bacterial transposable elements and contribute to improve genome annotations. Here, I characterized an insertion sequence, termed ISWpi1, for which the taxonomic distribution appears to be restricted to the obligate intracellular alpha-Proteobacterium Wolbachia pipientis. ISWpi1 exhibits approximately 46\% identity at the amino acid level with members of the IS1031 group of insertion sequences from the IS5 family. However, the IS1031 group is characterized by a transposase gene encoded by a single open reading frame, whereas the ISWpi1 transposase gene consists of two overlapping open reading frames presumably translated as a single protein via programmed translational frameshifting. Such structure suggests that ISWpi1 may instead be related to the IS427 group of insertion sequences from the IS5 family. Altogether, these data indicate that ISWpi1 extends the known spectrum of diversity of the IS5 family, and I propose to define a novel group of insertion sequences within the IS5 family typified by ISWpi1. Probable transpositional activity, relevant insertion site preferences and taxonomic specificity make ISWpi1 a promising tool for experimentally manipulating W. pipientis bacteria, especially in light of the increasing interest in developing these bacteria as tools for controlling insect disease vectors and agricultural pests.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria found in many species of arthropods and nematodes. They manipulate the reproduction of their arthropod hosts in various ways, may play a role in host speciation and have potential applications in biological pest control. Estimates suggest that at least 20\% of all insect species are infected with Wolbachia. These estimates result from several Wolbachia screenings in which numerous species were tested for infection; however, tests were mostly performed on only one to two individuals per species. The actual percent of species infected will depend on the distribution of infection frequencies among species. We present a meta-analysis that estimates percentage of infected species based on data on the distribution of infection levels among species. We used a beta-binomial model that describes the distribution of infection frequencies of Wolbachia, shedding light on the overall infection rate as well as on the infection frequency within species. Our main findings are that (1) the proportion of Wolbachia-infected species is estimated to be 66\%, and that (2) within species the infection frequency follows a ‘most-or-few’ infection pattern in a sense that the Wolbachia infection frequency within one species is typically either very high ({\textgreater}90\%) or very low ({\textless}10\%).},
